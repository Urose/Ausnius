<b style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Please note that any other websites that I am on that are not listed here could be listed on one of the sites above.</b>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I am not extremely active on Twitter, Tumblr or YouTube, mostly due to me being distracted or having too much time on my hands.
I do however post things every now and then. I actually spend a lot of my time drawing things and watching videos, with a little composing and some writing. (Take note that I'm currently 16
which means a lot of this information will be outdated in the future.)
Since this website is meant to list a few of my creations, let's give you a little fun fact about me, I have high-functioning autism, here's a little video I made about it a while back.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccbJUJhMJZc">Misconceptions of Autism Explained By An Actual Autistic on YouTube</a>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I'm currently working on a book, or I may have already finished it by now...Time, y'know?</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I dun' like bragging but I write a lot.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">A little more information before I conclude the rest of my babbling, I'm generally a loud person. There, the end.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Eheheheh, just kidding. I like to think I'm friendly. There, that's the end. Sorry for it being so brief, I'm lazy sometimes.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Actually, what's funny is that there isn't an actual end to this website, yet, anyways.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">(Hang on just deleting some old info...)</a>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">[DELETED]</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I also made a speed-draw on YouTube, it was kinda my best at the time, I'm always improving my style, though.</p>

   <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I made half of the first song in it and the rest of it was made by a close friend of mine, Blu_, I made the second song completely.</p>
