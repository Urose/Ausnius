<b style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Please note that any other websites that I am on that are not listed here could be listed on one of the sites above.</b>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I am not extremely active on Twitter, Tumblr or YouTube, mostly due to me being distracted or having too much time on my hands.
I do however post things every now and then. I actually spend a lot of my time drawing things and watching videos, with a little composing and some writing. (Take note that I'm currently 15
which means a lot of this information will be outdated in the future.)
Since this website is meant to list a few of my creations, let's give you a little fun fact about me, I have high-functioning autism, here's a little video I made about it a while back.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccbJUJhMJZc">Misconceptions of Autism Explained By An Actual Autistic on YouTube</a>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">It covers quite a bit and a few people even said it was funny, so there's something to look at.
I don't believe I've mentioned my story to anyone yet aside from my family and basically my whole school...Okay yeah, I probably did, now that I think about it.
So I'm writing a story! Yay! I'm not even done with it. A lot of my teachers at Innovation HS got a peek at the plot, so to speak. A lot of it is changing, though.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Y'all never heard my poems before, but don't worry, I'll be sharing a lot of it soon enough, everyone in my school says I'm pretty great at it.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">A little more information before I conclude the rest of my babbling, I'm generally a loud person. There, the end.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Eheheheh, just kidding. I like to think I'm friendly. There, that's the end. Sorry for it being so brief, I'm lazy sometimes.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">Actually, what's funny is that there isn't an actual end to this website, yet, anyways.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">So I made another video a while after and it was based off of depression/anxiety, and I would like to share that with you.</p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/gcVIKHzyfuU">The Reality Of Deep Sadness (Depression/Anxiety) on YouTube</a>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">It's an artistically styled piece of writing put into a voice-over that describes depression and anxiety in vivid detail.</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I also made a speed-draw on YouTube, it was kinda my best at the time, I'm always improving my style, though.</p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/9q4WeIwSwiw">Speed Draw || Lax In The Backlight on YouTube</a>
   <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:ariel;color:#600660">I made half of the first song in it and the rest of it was made by a close friend of mine, Blu_, I made the second song completely.</p>
