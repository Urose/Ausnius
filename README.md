A text based rpg game!
Anyone is free to contribute as long as they let me know, other than that, enjoy the game! I will be having students at my school checking this game out and maybe even playing it when they get severely bored, this is mostly a school project so don't expect much from it, I enjoy people checking out my works, so why not check this one out? Just remember not to take all of the credit when using this as a template, ok?
